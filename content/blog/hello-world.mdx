# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my journey, thoughts, and things I learn along the way.

## What to Expect

In this space, I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, and more
- **Backend**: NestJS, databases, API design
- **DevOps & Tools**: Docker, Git, automation
- **Random Thoughts**: Lo-fi design, cozy workflows, coffee ☕

## A Little About Me

I'm a Full Stack Developer who loves building comfortable, user-friendly web experiences. I believe in clean code, accessibility, and creating digital spaces that feel welcoming.
